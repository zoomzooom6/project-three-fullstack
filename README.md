**Description**: This is a full stack web application built using a MERN stack that connects small grocery stores to customers in order to help sell soon-to-be expired groceries at discounted prices. Small grocery stores may not be able to sell groceries on time which leads to financial loss and food wastage. Consequently, we developed a website that will bring these soon-to-be expired foods to the attention of customers which can enhance the foodsâ€™ sales at discounted prices, hence saving customers money on grocery shopping and preventing food wastage.
