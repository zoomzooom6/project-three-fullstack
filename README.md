# Let's Eat a Deal!
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Description**: Our food distribution platform built using a MERN stack connects small grocery store vendors to customers in order to help vendors sell soon-to-be expired groceries at discounted prices to customers, thus reducing vendors’ food wastage and customers’ food-related expenses.

**Motivation**: Small grocery stores face losses by the inability to sell items before the expiry dates. We came up with a solution to build a website that will attract customers with deals on items that are coming close to expiry. 

**Note**: We are currently in the process of debugging the application and improving the rendering of the complete front-end pages as shown below.
